# iManage

iManage is a task manager for agile software development.

- The user has a view to check out their tasks and projects and see all the existing projects in the team.

- A project has a backlog and it can have multiple sprints with multiple tasks.

- The tasks are dragable between backlog and sprints. The backlog and sprints can clear all the tasks at once. The Sprints are also deletable.

**Technology used:**

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, Ava and NYC.
- **Frontend:** Javascript, VueJS, Vuex, VueRouter, VueDraggable, Vue Material, Jest, Cypress.

## Requirements

This application relies heavily on ES6, and so either a recent version of Node or the browsers will be required.

## **ðŸ—„ Getting started in the Backend:**

To get the Node server running locally:

- Set up MongoDB locally. [Link](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center?jmp=nav#community) to get started (Click on 'Community Server' Tab to download).
  > If you have homebrew in your machine, use the following command in your Terminal: `brew install mongodb`. And then activate it with the command: `brew services start mongodb`.
- `npm install` to install all the dependencies.
- `nodemon index.js` to start the local server and database connection. (You will see logged in your console 'Server listening' and 'connected').
- View in browser at http://localhost:3000
